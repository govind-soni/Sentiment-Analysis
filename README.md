# What is Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. It is used to determine whether a given text contains negative, positive, or neutral emotions. It studies the subjective information in an expression, that is, the opinions, appraisals, emotions, or attitudes towards a topic, person or entity. Expressions can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral.
